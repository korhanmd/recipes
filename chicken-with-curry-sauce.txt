Ingredients:
 - 2 chicken breasts
 - 1/2 cup milk
 - 1 coffee spoon curry
 - 1 teaspoon salt
 - 1 tablespoon flour
 - 1/2 tea cup vegetable oil

Directions:
 1. Wash the chickens. Chop for saute.

 2. Mix milk, curry, salt and flour in a bowl to make sauce. Add chickens to this mix 
    and marinate them for 15 minutes.

    chickens soften.
